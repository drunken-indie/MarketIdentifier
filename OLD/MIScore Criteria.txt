#The higher the score, the worse the product opportunity
#Without the rank, the score will remain the same. 
#For Keepa Amazon rating is an integer from 0 to 50, so 4.5 star = 45, 5.0 star = 50, 3.1 star = 31 etc

For Amazon and Walmart:

If average price < $10 = 4/4 #Not enough margin

If 5 or more listings have a 5 star rating = 4/4 #No room For differentiation/Too competitive

If 5 or more listings have a review count of 500 AND average rating is > 4 = 4/4 #Established market/Too competitive

If 3 or more results are the same brand = 4/4 #Monopoly Type Market

If price > $25 AND average rating < 4 = 3/4 #Potential room for improvement on a high margin item

If < 5 star rating AND review count < 100 = 2/4 #Low demand, improvements might not be worth it

If price > $25 AND average review count <100 = 1/4 #High margin low competition



For eBay 


If > 3 listings have > 300 reviews = 4/4

If > 3 listings have > 4.5 star rating = 4/4

If average sales > 500 AND average rating > 4.5 = 4/4

If average sales > 500 AND average review count > 100 = 4/4


If brand > 3 = 4/4

If average rating <5 AND brand repetition <5 = 3/4


If review count <100 AND rating < 4.5 = 2/4


If average sales > 200 AND average rating < 5 = 1/4

If average sales > 200 AND average review count < 100 = 1/4

If average sales > 200 AND brand repetition < 3 = 1/4



default = 2/4
